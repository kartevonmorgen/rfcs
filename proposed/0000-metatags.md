# 0000 - Metatags

## Status
[status]: #status

Proposed

## Summary
[summary]: #summary

The high diversity of possible hashtags make it quite difficult to find all entries for one topic.
We can introduce Meta-tags: They are a container for different tags and are as ease to use as one 
tag but bring many more results.

## Context
[context]: #context

> This section describes the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

Many movements want to use the map for one topic,
but do not want to add one unig tag to all entries of that topic, to make this topic visible on one map.
 
- The "Social Economy" is a gerenal topic of our map. It can be #socent, #gwö, #b-corp, #sustainabel-finance... 
  But there is no hashtag everyone is using and it is impossible to teach all active mappers to use one common hashtag.
- #GWÖ is a commonly used hashtag, but some users just use special world like #energiefeld for a #gwö-regionalgroup.
  If #gwö becomes a Meta Tag, that does not matter
- We can solve **spelling errors**. If #urbangardening contains the hashtags #urban-guardening and #stadtgarten, 
  we automatically did a translation and connected synonyms and wrong written tags.
- #Futurefashion wants to create a map of all fair clothing-shops.
  Untill know a user would have to add all tags like #futurefashion #fairfashion #kleidung
 
# Future possibilities
[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities
 
- When we do legends and categories on any iframes, it can become really usefull to subgroup most of our content under 10 to 20 keywords.

## Decision
[decision]: #decision

> This section describes our response to these forces. It is stated in full sentences, with active voice. "We will ..."

## Consequences
[consequences]: #consequences

> This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.
